Learn and use Tableau for bikesharing

# *MODULE 14 – Des Moines CitiBike – README*
By Monica Holmes
May 2021

## *Purpose*
Use Tableau to provide data visualization that is easy to use and understand and convince investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal by providing a bike trip analysis. I will also use Pandas to convert data in a CSV file. 

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation and a written report on Des Moines - Bike Sharing Project Analysis

## *Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format*

For this analysis I used Tableau for visualizations and Pandas to convert the CSV file, “tripduration” column, to a DateTime datatype (00:00:00).

## *Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis -Checkout Times for Users*

This line graph shows the length of time bikes were checked out for all riders and the majority were about 10 minutes long.

 
**CHECKOUT TIMES BY GENDER:**

This line graph shows the length of time bikes were checked out by gender and that most rids last 5-10 minutes.

 
**GENDER BREAKDOWN:**

**TRIPS BY WEEKDAY FOR EACH HOUR HEATMAP:**

This heatmap shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day. The hours of 5-6pm and 8 am have the most use.


**TRIPS by GENDER (WEEKDAY per HOUR):**

Chart shows the number of bike trips per gender, by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. It also shows that both men and women's peak use is 5-6pm and 8am.


**AUGUST PEAK HOURS:**

**USER TRIPS BY GENDER by WEEKDAY:**

This graph shows the number of bike trips by gender and user type for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap. Also, "Subscribers" use the bikes more than "Customers".


## *Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation*

In Summary, the data shows males and “Subscribers” are the dominant users of CitiBikes and the peak bike use times are 5-6pm and 8am for both males and females.
