Learn and use Tableau for bikesharing

# *MODULE 14 – Des Moines CitiBike – README*
By Monica Holmes
May 2021

## *Purpose*
Use Tableau to provide data visualization that is easy to use and understand and convince investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal by providing a bike trip analysis. I will also use Pandas to convert data in a CSV file. 

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation and a written report on Des Moines - Bike Sharing Project Analysis

## *Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format*

For this analysis I used Tableau for visualizations and Pandas to convert the CSV file, “tripduration” column, to a DateTime datatype (00:00:00).
